Most of the orthologous gene names differ only in capitalization between human and mice (e.g. Pdcd1 vs PDCD1), and lower case conversion is sufficient to compare the majority of genes between the input and the reference data. Therefore, the user can benefit from the CIPR pipelines regardless of the species in the study.
